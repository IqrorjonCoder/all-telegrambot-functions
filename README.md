<h3>Numpy is</h3>

    This library provides a pure Python interface for the Telegram Bot API.
    Itâ€™s compatible with Python versions 3.7+. PTB might also work on PyPy, 
    though there have been a lot of issues before. Hence, PyPy is not officially supported.
    In addition to the pure API implementation, this library features a number of high-level 
    classes to make the development of bots easy and straightforward. These classes are contained
    in the telegram.ext submodule
